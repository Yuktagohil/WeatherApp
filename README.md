# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Public API steps

I have used openweathermap API. Steps to put API key.
Go to https://openweathermap.org/ website

Under API, Subscribe to OneCallAPI 3.0. It has free 1000 calls per day.(Dont forget to unsubscribe once you are done with it). It might take some time to activate. From API keys, copy the key which is there by default and paste it in weatherservice.js file.

Run the application by using npm start.
